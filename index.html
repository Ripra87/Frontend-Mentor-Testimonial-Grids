                            I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some peoplewho had an amazing 
                            experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
                            I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - 
                            time of my life. Since comleting the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a 
                            Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

                        <p>" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed 
                            some structure from professionals who can help me learn 
                            programming step by step. I was encorauged to enroll by a former student
                             of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The 
                             entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very 
                             hands-on and i never had to waut long for assistance. The agile team project, 
                             in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in 
                             a way that no tutorials could ever have. In fact, I've often
                             referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
                             It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving 
                             multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
